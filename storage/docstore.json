We are coming for your ill-begotten gains. \r\n\r\nAnd tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights \u2013 further isolating Russia \u2013 and adding an additional squeeze \u2013on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30% of its value. \r\n\r\nThe Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia\u2019s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame. \r\n\r\nTogether with our allies we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance. \r\n\r\nWe are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine. \r\n\r\nAnd we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering.  \r\n\r\nLet me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.  \r\n\r\nOur forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies \u2013 in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.  \r\n\r\nFor that purpose we\u2019ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. \r\n\r\nAs I have made crystal clear the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power.  \r\n\r\nAnd we remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days weeks, months, will be hard on them.  \r\n\r\nPutin has unleashed violence and chaos.  But while he may make gains on the battlefield \u2013 he will pay a continuing high price over the long run. \r\n\r\nAnd a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \r\n\r\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I\u2019ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \r\n\r\nAnd I\u2019m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\u2019s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \r\n\r\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \r\n\r\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \r\n\r\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what\u2019s happening can seem alarming. \r\n\r\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay. \r\n\r\nWhen the history of this era is written Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger. \r\n\r\nWhile it shouldn\u2019t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what\u2019s at stake now everyone sees it clearly.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3468, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"8bac3df9-d2b0-42f0-a221-4f19fd573bcc": {"node_ids": ["b9e6248d-30f8-4707-bf60-4cd57d5171d5"], "metadata": {"file_path": "D:\\smartCat\\Paul-Allen-Chatbot\\scraper\\data\\nesto.txt", "file_name": "nesto.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3501, "creation_date": "2025-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-29"}}}}
